Mission: the mission generated will be randomised, but usually it's about moving to the given directory using `cd` or move/copy a file/folder to another directory (usually `/` directory) using `mv` and `cp`. Also, use `ls` to check the files' names since most of them were hidden (????) by default. <br>
